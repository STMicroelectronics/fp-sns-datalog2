## __PDETECT_STWIN.box Application__

The **FP-SNS-DATALOG2** function pack provides a comprehensive solution to save data from any combination of sensors and
microphones configured up to the maximum sampling rate.
 
**PDetect** example for STEVAL-STWINBX1 + STEVAL-PDETECT1 for presence and motion detection has been added in 
FP-SNS-DATALOG2 v2.1.0.

Sensor data can be stored onto a micro SD card (Secure Digital High Capacity - SDHC) formatted with the FAT32
file system, or streamed to a PC via USB (WinUSBclass) using the companion host software (cli_example) provided
for Windows and Linux.

The application can be controlled via Bluetooth using the [**STBLESensor app**](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stblesensor.html)
which lets you manage the board and sensor configurations, start/stop data acquisition on SD card and control 
data labelling.

To read sensor data acquired using FP-SNS-DATALOG2, a few easy-to-use scripts in Python are provided
within the software package. The scripts have been successfully tested with Python 3.10.

FP-SNS-DATALOG2 firmware is based on application-level modules (**Sensor Manager**, **EMData**, â€¦) that 
customer can reuse and extend easily to build up its custom application.
These application modules adopt state-of-the-art design patterns, and they support natively low-power modes.
To enable this solution, the function pack has been built on top of **eLooM**, an Embedded Light Object Oriented fraMework 
for STM32 applications properly designed for embedded low power applications powered by STM32.
