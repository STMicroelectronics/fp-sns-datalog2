## __DATALOG2_NUCLEO-U575ZI-Q Application__

The **FP-SNS-DATALOG2** function pack provides a comprehensive solution to save data from any combination of sensors and
microphones configured up to the maximum sampling rate.
 
Sensor data can be streamed to a PC via USB (WinUSBclass) using the companion host software (cli_example) provided
for Windows and Linux.

To read sensor data acquired using FP-SNS-DATALOG2, a few easy-to-use scripts in Python are provided
within the software package. The scripts have been successfully tested with Python 3.10.

FP-SNS-DATALOG2 firmware is based on application-level modules (**Sensor Manager**, **EMData**, â€¦) that 
customer can reuse and extend easily to build up its custom application.
These application modules adopt state-of-the-art design patterns, and they support natively low-power modes.
To enable this solution, the function pack has been built on top of **eLooM**, an Embedded Light Object Oriented fraMework 
for STM32 applications properly designed for embedded low power applications powered by STM32.
