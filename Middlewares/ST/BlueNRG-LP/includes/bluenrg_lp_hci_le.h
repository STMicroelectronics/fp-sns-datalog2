/**
  * @brief The LE_Create_Connection command is used to create a Link Layer
  *        connection to a connectable advertiser. The le_scan_interval and

  *        Controller should scan. The le_scan_window parameter shall be set to a
  *        value smaller or equal to the value set for the le_scan_interval
  *        parameter. If both are set to the same value, scanning should run
  *        continuously. The initiator_filter_policy is used to determine whether
  *        the White List is used. If the White List is not used, the
  *        peer_address_type and the peer_address parameters specify the address
  *        type and address of the advertising device to connect to. The Link
  *        Layer shall set the address in the CONNECT_REQ packets to either the
  *        Public Device Address or the Random Device Addressed based on the
  *        own_address_type parameter. The conn_interval_min and

  *        parameter defines the maximum allowed connection latency (see [Vol 6]
  *        Part B, Section 4.5.1). The supervision_timeout parameter defines the
  *        link supervision timeout for the connection. The supervision_timeout
  *        in milliseconds shall be larger than (1 + conn_latency) *
  *        conn_interval_max * 2, where conn_interval_max is given in
  *        milliseconds. (See [Vol 6] Part B, Section 4.5.2). The
  *        minimum_ce_length and maximum_ce_length parameters are informative
  *        parameters providing the Controller with the expected minimum and
  *        maximum length of the connection events. The minimum_ce_length
  *        parameter shall be less than or equal to the maximum_ce_length
  *        parameter. The Host shall not issue this command when another

  * @brief The LE_Set_Periodic_Advertising_Data command is used to set the data
  *        used in periodic advertising PDUs. This command may be issued at any
  *        time after the advertising set identified by the advertising_handle
  *        parameter has been configured for periodic advertising using the
  *        LE_Set_Periodic_Advertising_Parameters Command (see Section 7.8.61),
  *        regardless of whether advertising in that set is enabled or disabled.
  *        If the advertising set has not been configured for periodic
  *        advertising, then the Controller shall return the error code Command
  *        Disallowed (0x0C). If advertising is currently enabled for the
  *        specified advertising set, the Controller shall use the new data in
  *        subsequent periodic advertising events for this advertising set. If a
  *        periodic advertising event is in progress when this command is issued,
  *        the Controller may use the old or new data for that event. If periodic
  *        advertising is currently disabled for the specified advertising set,
  *        the data shall be kept by the Controller and used once periodic
  *        advertising is enabled for that set. The data shall be discarded when
  *        the advertising set is removed. Only the significant part of the
  *        periodic advertising data should be transmitted in the advertising
  *        packets as defined in [Vol 3] Part C, Section 11. The Host may set the
  *        periodic advertising data in one or more operations using the
  *        operation parameter in the command. If the combined length of the data
  *        exceeds the capacity of the advertising set identified by the
  *        advertising_handle parameter (see Section 7.8.57 LE Read Maximum
  *        Advertising Data Length Command) or the amount of memory currently
  *        available, all the data shall be discarded and the Controller shall
  *        return the error code Memory Capacity Exceeded (0x07). If operation
  *        indicates the start of new data (values 0x01 or 0x03), then any
  *        existing partial or complete data shall be discarded. If the
  *        advertising_data_length parameter is 0, then operation shall be 0x03;
  *        this indicates that any existing partial or complete data shall be
  *        deleted and no new data provided.

  *        are non-zero, the Controller shall scan for the duration of the
  *        Duration parameter within a scan period specified by the Period
  *        parameter. After the scan period has expired, a new scan period shall
  *        begin and scanning shall begin again for the duration specified. The
  *        scan periods continue until the Host disables scanning. If the

  *        the primary and secondary advertising channels. However, expiry of the
  *        duration does not prevent the Link Layer from scanning for and

  *        not scanning is enabled and scanning may be enabled and disabled (see
  *        the LE Set Extended Scan Enable Command) while this command is
  *        pending. However, synchronization can only occur when scanning is
  *        enabled. While scanning is disabled, no attempt to synchronize will
  *        take place. The Filter_Policy parameter is used to determine whether
  *        the Periodic Advertiser List is used. If the Periodic Advertiser List
  *        is not used, the advertising_sid, Advertiser address_type, and
  *        Advertiser Address parameters specify the periodic advertising device
  *        to listen to; otherwise they are ignored. The advertising_sid
  *        parameter, if used, specifies the value that must match the
  *        Advertising SID subfield in the ADI field of the received
  *        advertisement for it to be used to synchronize. The Skip parameter
  *        specifies the number of consecutive periodic advertising packets that
  *        the receiver may skip after successfully receiving a periodic
  *        advertising packet. The sync_timeout parameter specifies the maximum
  *        permitted time between successful receives. If this time is exceeded,
  *        synchronization is lost. The Unused parameter is reserved for future
  *        use. Irrespective of the value of the Skip parameter, the Controller
  *        should stop skipping packets before the sync_timeout would be
  *        exceeded. If the Host issues this command when another
  *        LE_Periodic_Advertising_Create_Sync command is pending (see page
  *        1380), the Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed
  *        (0x0C). If the Host issues this command for a periodic advertising set
  *        from an advertiser that the Controller is already synchronized to, the
  *        Controller shall return the error code Connection Already Exists

/**
  * @brief This command is used to start a test where the DUT generates test
  *        reference packets at a fixed interval. The Controller shall transmit
  *        at the power level indicated by the transmit_power_level parameter.
  *        The tx_channel and PHY parameters specify the RF channel and PHY to be
  *        used by the transmitter. If the Host sets the PHY parameter to a PHY
  *        that the Controller does not support, including a value that is
  *        reserved for future use, the Controller shall return the error code
  *        Unsupported Feature or Parameter Value (0x11). The test_data_length
  *        and packet_payload parameters specify the length and contents of the
  *        Payload of the test reference packets. An LE Controller supporting the
  *        HCI_LE_Transmitter_Test command shall support packet_payload values
  *        0x00, 0x01 and 0x02. An LE Controller supporting the LE Coded PHY
  *        shall also support packet_payload value 0x04. An LE Controller may
  *        support other values of packet_payload. The cte_length and cte_type
  *        parameters specify the length and type of the Constant Tone Extension
  *        in the test reference packets. If the cte_type parameter is set to
  *        0x01 and the Controller does not support 1 microsecond switching, the
  *        Controller shall return the error code Unsupported Feature or
  *        Parameter Value (0x11). If cte_length is not zero and PHY specifies a
  *        PHY that does not allow Constant Tone Extensions, the Controller shall
  *        return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C). The
  *        switching_pattern_length and antenna_ids[i] parameters specify the
  *        antenna switching pattern. They are only used when transmitting an AoD
  *        Constant Tone Extension and shall be ignored when transmitting an AoA
  *        Constant Tone Extension. If the Controller determines that any of the
  *        antenna_ids[i] values do not identify an antenna in the device's
  *        antenna array, it shall return the error code Unsupported Feature or
  *        Parameter Value (0x11). Note: Some Controllers may be unable to
  *        determine which values do or do not identify an antenna. The
  *        transmit_power_level parameter specifies the transmit power level to
  *        be used by the transmitter. If the parameter is set to a value other
  *        than 0x7E or 0x7F, then the Controller shall make the requested change
  *        or shall make the nearest change that it is capable of doing.
