  * @date    20-July-2023
  * @brief   Header file which contains definition of Bluetooth status and error codes.
  * @note    Error Codes are defined according to Bluetooth Specifications 
  *              Vol.2 Part D.
  *           - HCI/Controller standard codes range is [0x00 : 0x3F].
  *             Their name is prefixed by "BLE_ERROR_" 
  *           - Host specific (and proprietary) error codes range is [0x80 : 0xFF].
  *             Their name is prefixed by "BLE_STATUS_" and they're grouped by Layer
  *           - BLE_STATUS_SUCCESS value is 0x00 and is the unique error code
  *             used by both Controller and Host layers.
